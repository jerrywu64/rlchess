AI Notes

Things the AI might care about: (Note that original cost of number of moves is around 1200)
* material (cost is around 64)
* development - number of available moves (cost is around 1200)
* threats - check one move ahead, see what you can do (cost is around 60000)

Pruning:
* If a board evaluates badly, drop it. This can miss combinations but whatever.

Opening book
* Would be useful because nothing happens at the beginning.
