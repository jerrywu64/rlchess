Implementation of Rocket Launcher Chess, and will be used in an attempt to solve Rocket Launcher Chess.

Rocket Launcher Chess is a chess variant which blends Rifle Chess and Atomic Chess. In Rifle Chess, when pieces capture, they don't move; the enemy piece just dies. In Atomic Chess, when pieces capture, all pieces in a 3x3 square centered at the capture point die.

In Rocket Launcher Chess, well, you can imagine. If you're thinking "wait, doesn't that make queens incredibly overpowered?", you probably understand the game mechanics correctly.
